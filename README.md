# My notes and code about Data structures.


I will try to implement some data structures using Python, Clojure and (C++ or C).

The idea is to study data structure and improve my skills. And try to think a new
design to some structures.

This is the CI to run my tests in python to data structures implementations

## What Are Data structures?

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
